# Outlet stores' performance research

In this project I will assess the performance of the sales outlets of a building-materials retailer.

The data is compiled from a table with the purchases made at the different stores of the chain and from a table with the prices of the products.

The end goal is to increase the overall profits of the chain, by finding the successful and failing stores, understanding their properties, and making better business decisions.

The main steps of the project will be:
- Loading the data.
- Preparing the data for analysis by discovering and treating issues.
- Carrying out exploratory data analysis.
- Assessing the performance of the sales outlets.
- Testing statistical hypotheses.
- Drawing conclusions and formulating recommendations.
- Preparing a presentation to present the findings.
- Preparing a Tableau dashboard to present the findings.
